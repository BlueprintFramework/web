#### Pterodactyl v1.12 compatibility

Blueprint is now compatible with Pterodactyl `v1.12.0`. Read more in the [related blog post](/blog/pterodactyl-v1_12_0).

#### Onboarding modal

We've added an onboarding modal that provides you useful links to our Discord community and privacy policy. This onboarding modal will show up whenever you use Blueprint for the first time (or update to any release containing the onboarding modal for the first time). It can be manually triggered by setting the `introduction_dismissed` flag to `false`.

#### Node.js version requirement

**We've increased the Node.js version requirement from `v17.x` to `v20.x`.** While Pterodactyl updated their minimum version requirement to `v22.x`, we're giving you a bit more time to migrate over.

#### Additional changes

- Updated the general description of what Blueprint is on the extensions admin page.
- The copyright footer in the admin panel now switches between Pterodactyl and Blueprint depending on the page you're visiting, instead of adding Blueprint to the copyright footer.
- The `disable_attribution` flag is no longer visibly displayed in the Blueprint flags editor. If you previously had this flag disabled, it will stay disabled. You will have to use the API or interact with the database to update this flag from now on.
