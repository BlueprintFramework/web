summary: Primarily Blueprint CLI utility improvements

#### Changes

- Add bash autocompletion which can be initialized by adding `source blueprint` to your `.bashrc` (or `.zshrc` if using zsh).
- Add support for installing and removing multiple extensions at once. This implementation also only runs resource-heavy commands once if any of the installed extensions require it (such as webpack asset rebuilding).
- Move libraries required by the `blueprint.sh` file into `scripts/libraries` and symlink the old location.
- Move `-install`, `-remove`, `-init`, `-build`, `-export`, `-wipe`, `-version`, `-help`, `-info`, `-debug`, `-upgrade` and `-rerun-install` into their own files under `scripts/commands`.
- Add support for upgrading from repositories that aren't hosted on GitHub.
- Update upstream [`parse_yaml`](https://github.com/mrbaseman/parse_yaml/blob/master/src/parse_yaml.sh) script used for reading extension configurations.
- Alt text of extension icons are now their identifier.
- Entries on the extensions page are now inline with the page title.

#### Bugfixes

- Remove command was not functional - this has now been fixed.
- Input validation was done incorrectly on Blueprint's admin page causing validation errors when toggling developer mode or telemetry.
- Entries on the extensions page were able to overlap the Pterodactyl copyright footer.
