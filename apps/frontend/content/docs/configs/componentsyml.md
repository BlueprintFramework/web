::card
The `Components.yml` configuration lives in the root of an extension's `dashboard.components` directory. You have to create a directory, bind it in [conf.yml](/docs/configs/confyml#dashboardcomponents) and create a `Components.yml` file. All components should be placed in this (or a sub-)directory too.
::

## Introduction

Blueprint's `Components.yml` configuration file allows an extension to add [React components](https://legacy.reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#what-is-react) to predefined "areas" of the Pterodactyl panel's user frontend. Multiple extensions can extend the same component without conflicting with eachother.

### Why React?

Simply because Pterodactyl's frontend uses React. Blueprint's components implementation extends Pterodactyl's frontend and allows extensions to add components/pages to it.

## Component paths

When referencing components in your Components.yml, Blueprint expects the component's relative (to the `dashboard:components` directory) file path without the file extension. It sounds complicated, but in practice it's quite easy, here are a few examples:

| Path                                                        | Issues (if any)                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <code class="text-red-400">../Component.tsx</code>          | Path escapes the `dashboard:components` directory and ends with a file extension         |
| <code class="text-red-400">@/Element</code>                 | Only components provided by the extension's `dashboard:components` directory can be used |
| <code class="text-red-400">ExampleComponent.tsx</code>      | Path ends with with a file extension                                                     |
| <code class="text-green-400">ExampleComponent</code>        | No issues                                                                                |
| <code class="text-green-400">subdirectory/HelloWorld</code> | No issues                                                                                |

## Routes

To define a route, add an entry to the `Navigation.Routes` list in the `Components.yml` configuration.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml [Components.yml]
Navigation:
  Routes:
    - { Name: 'Example route', Path: '/exampleroute', Type: 'account', Component: 'MyExampleRoute', AdminOnly: 'false' }
```

Routes have a few configuration options, each with their own purpose and restrictions.

| Option                 | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Name` (optional)      | The route name visible in the Pterodactyl navigation bar. When left blank, the page will be set as 'unlisted' |
| `Path`                 | URL path for the custom route, relative to `/server/[id]/` or `/account/` depending on the defined `Type`     |
| `Type`                 | Can be either `server` or `account` and determines whether the route is an 'server' route or 'account' route  |
| `Component`            | Path to the route's component                                                                                 |
| `AdminOnly` (optional) | Can be either `true` or `false` and determines whether or not the page is exclusively available to admins     |

### Egg-specific routes

System administrators can set which "eggs" have which routes [as explained in the Manage extensions guide](/guides/admin/extensions#configuring-extensions), with no extension-side implementation needed. Extensions can't predefine on which eggs to display their routes.

### Conflicts

While components themselves are very unlikely to conflict with each other, **routes totally can**. Make sure to not use generic routes names and paths to prevent breakage.

## Building components

Components are created using React and exist in the same environment as Pterodactyl. Before building your first component, make sure you are familiar with the following do-s and don't-s:

| <span class="text-green-400">Do</span>                                  | <span class="text-red-400">Don't</span>                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Do make requests to client API routes                                   | **DON'T EVER STORE TOKENS OR API CREDENTIALS USERS SHOULDN'T HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO**                  |
| Do use Pterodactyl- and [your extension's API](/docs/concepts/routing)s | Don't query external site APIs directly from the React application/frontend                           |
| Do build with Pterodactyl's existing components or your own             | Don't rely on other extension's components                                                            |
| Do extend the Pterodactyl user interface                                | Don't modify the dashboard in a way that would (hypothetically) prevent other extensions from working |

With that out of the way, let's create a component in your extension's `dashboard.components` directory.

### Creating a basic component

Create a file called `MyFirstComponent.tsx` in your `dashboard.components` directory and add the following content to it.

```tsx [MyFirstComponent.tsx]
// Import React from the react library
import React from 'react'

// Create a function and set it as the default
// function for this file
export default = () => {
  // Return the component's contents
  return (
    <>
      {/* Add a paragraph element */}
      <p>this is my first component!</p>
    </>
  )
}
```

Then, bind it to a placement area in your Components.yml configuration. In this example, we're adding it to `Dashboard.Serverlist.BeforeContent`.

```yaml [Components.yml]
Dashboard:
  Serverlist:
    BeforeContent: 'MyFirstComponent'
```

After installing your extension, you should see the component appear above the Pterodactyl serverlist.

## Configuration

### Example configuration

Here is an example (valid) Components.yml configuration.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml [Components.yml]
Navigation:
  NavigationBar:
    BeforeNavigation: 'HelloWorldComponent'
  Routes:
    - { Name: 'My Extension', Path: '/myextension', Type: 'server', Component: 'sections/MyExtensionSection', AdminOnly: 'false' }
    - { Name: 'Security keys', Path: '/securitykeys', Type: 'account', Component: 'sections/SecurityKeysSection', AdminOnly: 'false' }

Account:
  Overfiew:
    BeforeContent: 'UserGreeterComponent'
    AfterContent: 'HelloWorldComponent' #you can use the same component in multiple places!
```
