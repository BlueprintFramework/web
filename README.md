# web-rewrite

Blueprint's new website, made with Nuxt and Rust.

[`apps/frontend`](/apps/frontend) - The application frontend\
[`apps/backend`](/apps/backend) - The application backend

## Why a rewrite?

Blueprint's website was quite overdue for a change, both documentation-wise and the overall website format. We set out to create a brand new website for Blueprint to support our upcoming plans and integrations natively on our platform.

## Developing with the API
