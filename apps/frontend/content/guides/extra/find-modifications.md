## Introduction

Pterodactyl themes and addons can be found in quite a few places, though not all sides of the internet may be trustworthy.
We've compiled a list of marketplaces and their pros and cons, as well as inform you about risks trusting modifications from unverified sources.

## Blueprint's extensions list

> The best place to find trustworthy extensions is to use the [Blueprint extensions list](/browse).
> It provides links towards extension listings verified by Blueprint's administrators.

## BuiltByBit

[BuiltByBit](https://builtbybit.com?ref=581299) is quite a large marketplace, though it suffers from it sheer amount of products, often letting through broken and lower quality Pterodactyl themes, Pterodactyl addons, Blueprint themes and Blueprint extensions.

That said, it does provide local payment gateways and the ability to check out multiple products at once. It does, however, charge creators a ~10% fee on all purchases made through the platform.

## Stay away from untrusted sources

There are quite a few untrusted sources often redistributing Pterodactyl-related products.
These websites often add malware or untrusted code to the files you download from them, with little to no moderation or source code audits.
