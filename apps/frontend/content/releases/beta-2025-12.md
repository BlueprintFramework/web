### Themes

This version rolls back the theming changes made in [beta-2025-11](/releases/beta-2025-11) ([blog post](/blog/update-on-themes)). The Tailwind color variable editing support has been removed.

### New updater

We've implemented a new update tool for Blueprint. Updating to this version will require you to run the `blueprint -upgrade` command twice, instead of just once. This shouldn't be much of an issue, the CLI will guide you through the process.
