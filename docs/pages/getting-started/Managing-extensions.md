# Managing Extensions

  <div class="ps-3 ms-3">Blueprint extensions must be installed, updated, built and removed via the command line. Shell access is required to perform these actions.</div>

### **Install Extensions**

<div class="alert mt-2 rounded-4 border" role="alert">
  <i class="bi bi-exclamation-diamond mb-1 text-danger float-start fs-4"></i>
  <div class="ps-3 ms-3"><strong>Only use extensions from trusted sources</strong> such as <strong><a href="/browse">Blueprint's extension repository</a></strong>, <a href="https://sourcexchange.net">sourceXchange</a> or <a href="https://builtbybit.com">BuiltByBit</a>. Third-party sources may contain unverified or malicious code.</div>
</div><br/>

To install a Blueprint extension, move the `.blueprint` file into your Pterodactyl root directory, usually `/var/www/pterodactyl`.<br>

Then run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
blueprint -install (extension)
```
Replace `(extension)` with the name of the extension or the exact filename of the `.blueprint` file. This will trigger the installation process.

<br>

### **Remove Extensions**

To uninstall a Blueprint extension, run the following command:
```sh
blueprint -remove (extension)
```
Replace `(extension)` with the name of the extension you want to remove. This will safely remove the extension and its associated components.

<br>

### **Manage extension specific settings**

Once an extension is installed, you can configure its settings directly from the Pterodactyl admin dashboard.

1.  Log in to the admin interface.

2.  Click on the puzzle piece icon <i class="bi bi-puzzle-fill"></i> in the top-right corner to open the Extensions Overview.

3.  From here, select the extension you wish to manage.
    This will open a configuration view where you can adjust extension-specific options.

  <i class="bi bi-info-circle mb-1 float-start fs-4"></i>
  <div class="ps-3 ms-3">Settings interfaces are defined by the extension developer and may vary depending on the extension. Some even don't have settings at all.</div>
