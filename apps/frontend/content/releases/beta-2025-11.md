#### Themes and UI

- Themes can now adjust Tailwind colors through CSS variables! ([Dashboard colors](/docs/themes/colors))
- Alias Blueprint UI properties.

#### URL updates

- Updated the documentation link shown in the extensions admin page when you didn't install Blueprint properly.
- Updated the API base URL to the new endpoint.

#### Cache overlay (admin)

- cacheOverlay was removed a while ago, but it's CSS was still there. This has now been fixed!

#### CLI

- The CLI did not automatically put [Blueprint Docker](https://github.com/blueprintframework/docker) installations out of maintenance mode.
- When upgrading, Blueprint did not migrate hidden files and directories at directory moveover, causing them to be deleted. It is important to note that this fix is for a bug in the initial upgrading process. The fix will only work for upgrading **from** this release, **not to**.
